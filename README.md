### 1. Python Village
If you are completely new to programming, try these initial problems to learn a few basics about the Python programming language. You'll get familiar with the operations needed to start solving bioinformatics challenges in the Stronghold.

### 2. Bioinformatics Stronghold
Discover the algorithms underlying a variety of bioinformatics topics: computational mass spectrometry, alignment, dynamic programming, genome assembly, genome rearrangements, phylogeny, probability, string algorithms and others.

### 3. Bioinformatics Armory
Ready-to-use software tools abound for bioinformatics analysis. Whereas in the Stronghold you implement algorithms on your own, in the Armory you solve similar problems by using existing tools.

### 4. Bioinformatics Textbook Track
A collection of exercises to accompany Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active-Learning Approach by Phillip Compeau & Pavel Pevzner. A full version of this text is hosted on stepic.org

### 5. Algorithmic Heights
A collection of exercises in introductory algorithms to accompany "Algorithms", the popular textbook by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani.
